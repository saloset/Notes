## Definitions: 
**Single sourcing:** Refers to a content management strategy where content is derived from a single intelligent source and reconstructed in multiple formats according to the project. This makes it easy to create multiple documents using the same information that is already stored in a database such as Madcap Flare. For example, this would be useful when starting with a simple text document that needs to be converted to HTML, PDF, and XML. Through single sourcing, the document will only need to be authored once and can be repurposed according to the requirements for each subsequent output.
