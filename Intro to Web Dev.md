# Odin Project Intro
### What do web developers do?
Web devs build and maintain websites
* Often work for clients to get a product onto the web. 
* This work involves collaboration between teams, devs, and the client itself.
* Work could involve **Front end, back end, or full stack** web development.

* **Front end** refers to the stuff you see on the browser. Devs use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their frameworks to present their content. 
* **Back end** is basically the backbone of the page or app, which lives on the server side of things. Devs use programming languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby to work with the data.
* **Full-stack** refers to the use of both front end and back end principles.

### When asking for help from others
Asking well formed, thought out, and context based questions allows for higher quality feedback.
* Always provide your code and surrounding context. 
* Asking vague, conceptual questions will yield vague, conceptual answers.
* Provide as much context as necessary so that respondents can provide the most relevant answers while assisting you
* **Ask about the problem at hand** instead of just asking for a solution. You're actually the one who needs to be solving the issue as a learner. Ask for help on the specifics rather than just asking someone to fix it for you.
* Let people know what you've tried and what hasn't worked. This allows the respondent to help with your current iteration of code rather than giving you advice that would set you back several steps.
* Getting asked for more context is not something to fret about, respondents are simply trying to understand your request better and *want* to help!

* *(from article)* Explain the context. Explain the exact steps you took to produce the problem. Explain what you expect to see. Explain what you actually see,
* Provide the code that illustrates the problem. Isolate that code and make sure that it doesn't change by the time someone looks at it. 
* Make sure the code you share reproduces the problem. 
* Ensure that your code is written consistently. 
* Explain what you did to troubleshoot.
* Explain what you think the problem might be.
* Proofread your question
* Thank each respondent and inform them when the problem is solved so they don't waste any more time solving it.
* 'code' is how you include code into markdown.

**Quick tips for answering questions**
* Instead of answering the question, *guide* them to the answer
