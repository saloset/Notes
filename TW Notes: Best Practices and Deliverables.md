# TW Notes – Best Practices and Deliverables
This document contains notes from various online resources as well as *The Insider's Guide to Technical Writing* - a book by Krista Van Laan

# **Best Practices**

- Understand your user and their needs _then_ figure out how to use the rules of best practices from there.

### Active voice and word choice
- Use active voice in all writing. (57)
- Using active voice leads to less ambiguity because it makes it obvious who the subject and what the verb is.
- Active voice tends to use fewer words which enhances clarity. You can also force the writer to better understand the subject because in order to write in active voice, you need to have complete command over what you're writing about.
- There is no need to use unnecessarily large words. The shortest word that conveys the message works just as good. Still, it is important to use the same language that your audience would use.

### Bullet lists and typeface

- Utilize bullet lists. They are useful for emphasizing important information in an easy-to-read format along with creating more white space that helps your page become more readable.
- Always introduce your bullet list with a title and a short introduction as to provide context.
- Bullet lists must always follow parallel form.
- Avoid bullet lists when describing a sequence or describing items of differing importance.
- When emphasizing a word or phrase, manipulating the type face can help draw attention to that word or phrase.
- It&#39;s important not to overdo emphasis as the reader could begin to ignore the words after too many uses.

### Culture and gender considerations

- Use gender neutral language such as _them_, _they_ and other plural pronouns.
- Avoid humor in your writing as it often is misinterpreted by the reader and adds unnecessary cultural limitations to your document.

### Formatting and language rules

- Technical writers use the **imperative** (giving direct commands) mood to write their instructions.
- Keep your paragraphs to no more than 6 lines and keep your sentences to less than 25 words.
- As to not overload the audience, short paragraphs are necessary to make it easy for the reader to absorb the information. Even a single sentence paragraph can work fine.
- Keep wordiness in mind when editing – shortening keeps things simple. (Examples on 65)
- **Look** into Simplified Technical English 100 (STE100)
- Avoid negatives where possible. Using negatives opens the door for misunderstanding, slowing down the reader, and the accidental introduction of double negatives.
- Keep your document in present tense. Assume that your reader is following each instruction while simultaneously performing the task.
- Address the reader directly using &quot;you&quot;. Much like using the imperative, using second person allows you to directly instruct the user, which allows for greater clarity, more consistent use of active voice, and shorter documents.
- Second person may feel a little bit informal, however, in technical writing it is more acceptable than in scientific writing. Academic or scientific writing can be harder to read versus technical writing, where the point is to clarify things in his few of words as possible.
- Always use a serial comma to reduce ambiguity in a series.
- Avoid the word _should_ as that can be misinterpreted as a suggestion. _Must_ is a good substitute, however, use discretion.

### Procedure

- When writing a procedure, every process will have two points: a trigger point and an endpoint.
- A **trigger point** is where the procedure starts and should either begin at the last step of a previous process in the series, or an introductory paragraph preceding the procedure.
- The **endpoint** is the conclusion of the procedure, and it should be a point where the user has succeeded in reaching a goal, whether that be a midpoint, milestones, or endpoint.
- Procedural guidelines on **page 70**
- Address only one significant action or one small group of related actions in each step.
- When working with long procedures, it can help to use step heading, which is where the writer groups the steps into substeps separated by a bold heading.
- One final best practice to remember is that showing respect to the reader is essential to writing concise and accurate instructions. Don&#39;t waste the readers time by dancing around the subject or by using unnecessarily large words.

# **Audience**

- The first and most important question a technical writer must answer with regard to their audience is **who**
- Before starting any project, determining who the intended user is would be ideal. A manager or product expert should hopefully tell you exactly who you&#39;re writing for, however, the onus may be on the writer as well.
- Sometimes, there are several different users for the same product, each with their own needs. Aside from just the end-user, there may be several others who interact with the product before it even makes it to market.
- It is very common for a technical writer to create documentation intended for people who know far more about the technology you&#39;re writing about than you do.
- Writing for any user involves task analysis in which you determine the tasks your users need to perform and what it will take to perform those tasks.

### The user

- It helps to create a persona that resembles your intended end user to help guide your writing.
- _What is the user&#39;s goal?_ should be the main question for which you create your documentation around.
- How often will the user refer to the documentation? It helps to know whether the user is expected to use this as a quick reference, or a recurring procedure.
- Identifying any problems the user might encounter is important for the troubleshooting steps of your documentation.
- Understanding your users&#39; technical ability and whether or not the audience is English speaking is very important. Knowing this allows for the writer to avoid colloquialisms, local jargon, and other terms that may otherwise alienate certain users.

### The novice end user

- You must always provide documentation for the novice end-user user. A novice will know nothing about your product before interacting with it and therefore you must write to accommodate that.
- Novice users tend to like something short and simple with which they can begin the process quickly. Think: quick start guides, user references, and short setups. They should use visuals, images, and highlights to emphasize the important steps.

### The expert user

- Unlike the novice user, the expert typically doesn&#39;t want to read the details and repetitive processes with every step spelled out. They understand the process and the product already and are more likely to refer to the documentation whenever they need to address an error or figure out how to do some thing they hadn&#39;t done before.
- Expert users want searchable, discoverable content to address a task they have in specific. This includes online help, release notes, troubleshooting, and reference guides.

### Writing for the consumer

- When writing for a consumer, it is important to keep in mind you&#39;re your documentation leaves an impression on the user and can affect their future choices with the company.
- You don&#39;t want to create documentation that would drive the user to return the product because it is too complicated. It could be helpful to include a quick start guide, however, it&#39;s also important to thoroughly explain the use of the product so that those who do want to read it in more detail or who need more thorough help can use the documentation as a reference. You may also create online help, videos, or web-based PDFs to guide the user.
- When writing installation documentation, it must be comprehensive, concise, and clear. This, in turn, will help the user avoid problems during set up.
- With installation documentation, the goal is very clear – create a document that can help guide the user from start to finish of installing the product.

### Writing for operations and developers

- Creating documentation for operations people can be geared towards IT, data, or network administrators. Simply, this documentation includes operations guide, troubleshooting documentation, **run books** , and system administrative documentation.
- Writing for developers typically involves a lot of inward facing documents such as private wiki&#39;s, informal communication such as email, or notes. At times, the technical writer will come in, clean this up, and create a set of documents that takes all of these into account.

### Writing as customer support

- Trainees and trainers are another audience the author must write for because with various products, there are people devoted to teaching their users how to use the product. It&#39;s important to have a good relationship with the trainers in your company as they act as a bridge between your documentation and the user. They will have insight on what your documents do well and what you can improve upon, and at times you will have to create documentation specifically for their needs.
- In a way, the technical writer will be a customer support representative in that they will create content for the actual customer support team – they will also create online help and documentation centered around frequently asked questions, knowledge bases, and other centralized repositories of information to hopefully keep users from having to contact customer support in the first place.
- Customer support can also be a great insight into what your documentation can improve upon because they know where customers have the most complaints regarding the software.

### Writing for all users

- Of course, with all these users in mind, you will often times have to write for several if not all of these users within the same document. You can&#39;t just write five or six different manuals depending on the user, you must incorporate them all within to one or two documents. You don&#39;t want to discourage the user by throwing a bunch of booklets at them, leaving the impression that the product is over-complicated.
- A common way of navigating this is by introducing key points, including a quick start guide at the beginning of your manuals, and then addressing the more task based and specific content after that.
- Test your content and try to keep the user&#39;s method of using your documentation in mind so that you can better anticipate their needs. It can be redundant to write documentation that differs greatly from the preferred user method of completing the task. Reaching out to the user experience team in addition to doing user testing is a great way to ensure that the bridge between developer and user is going well.
- Make a note of where you have trouble, ask around for others, and use that to figure out the best way to cover your content.
- Review accessibility concepts

# **Deliverables**

- Start by defining a few types of documentation deliverables and build around them.
- Avoid copying excess content from one document to another as this can make it difficult to maintain both documents. For example, if you go to update one of your documents, you or your team may not realize that it needs to be updated in the different document that you added it to.
- The best way to avoid these problems is to _single source_ and apply _content reuse principles_ **.****  **
- **Single sourcing** refers to the development of content with the intent of producing all or part of it in multiple formats.
- This usually means that you have all the information stored in one place and then you use that information to create individual deliverables.
- **Content reuse** refers to the management of content by breaking it into small enough components so that each topic can be used in the appropriate place.
- **Topic oriented writing** is writing that is intended for reuse. Each _topic_ is a unit of information that stands alone with the intent of being mixed and matched with other topics to create a deliverable.
- Single sourcing can start out as many different formats from a single PDF file that contains information, to more complex XML or HTML books. Regardless, any changes to the deliverables are made by changing the source document.
- When creating source content, the appropriate use of tagging allows for you to create various documents from that source.
- It&#39;s important to determine whether your document needs to be **task based** or **reference based**
- **Task based** documentation is about what the user does with instructions on how to complete a particular task.
- With task-based documentation, it&#39;s important to clearly define a starting point and a stopping point for each task. In other words, where does the procedure start and where would you find the final step?
- Use consistent formatting, grammar, and incorporate parallelism within your steps for clarity.
- In **reference-based** documentation, the focus is more on what the product does rather than the steps a user might take to complete the task.
- Explaining each and every function of the product and how they interact so that the user can put together what needs to be done is an example of reference-based documentation.
- Glossaries, command references, release notes, and other descriptive documentation types tend to be reference based.
- To create reference-based documentation, go through the application or device&#39;s user interface and describe every single component accurately and consistently. Emphasis on every component.


# Types of documentation
*This section includes information about the types of documentation a technical writer may be expected to work on.*
### End user documentation

- End user documentation explains how to use the features of a product. It is intended to help users meet specific goals.
- Given its importance, end user documentation often comes in multiple formats such as PDF, printed user guides, quick start guides, tutorials, FAQs, and more.
- End user documentation is typically a favorite of technical writers because it&#39;s easy to put oneself in the user&#39;s shoes and define a beginning and end point. Still, however, it is important to work with developers to create these manuals throughout production.
- User guides should be task-based because the user typically wants to learn how to do XYZ rather than what individual features are. Emphasizing the _end goal_ aspect of task based.
- Error messages are very important to user experience. If possible, it is best to include descriptions of the error and possible solutions into the error message rather than just a string of numbers and letters.
- Instead of long procedure of documents, many users like the product to have tutorials to _show_ them what it is they need to do.
- A tutorial is likely used just one time by a fraction of users; however, those users will be very grateful for the step-by-step annotation.
- **Help content** is a rather broad term, however, it typically refers to task-oriented modules that come up when a user clicks a help link or icon within an application.
- Help content is typically produced with a help authoring tool that enables the linking, searching, and indexing of various topics.
- Help content requires a different structure from that of a manual in that with manuals, users can be expected to go from start to finish. Help content, on the other hand needs to be written for a user who is looking for immediate solutions to a specific problem.
- Your user wants easily available answers for the most common and important activities when it comes to help documents. That could mean the content is right there on the page, in a pop-up, call outbox when the user scrolls over the help icon, or even an FAQ on its own set of webpages.

### Installation documentation

- Installation can involve anything from clicking a couple of buttons on a wizard to configuring complex servers. In any case, you must make sure that the information is correct, complete, and presented in sequential order.
- When done properly, installation documentation should be used exactly one time. For this reason, it is best to keep it separate from standard end user documentation, which is expected to be used regularly.
- Installation documentation should be available before the actual product is installed which means it must be distributed in a format that makes this possible. These include hardcopy printed pieces, PDF or web components, and or a webpage with web help.
- When planning installation documentation, keep the following in mind -

- _Prerequisites_: Let the user know everything they must have in order to complete the installation process. This includes specific software, required disc space or memory, authentication keys + digital certificates, time, and equipment.
- _Context_: Make sure to let the user know where to begin and keep in mind what step will be the end goal (installation, in this case).
- _Dependencies_: Let the user know if there are any specific steps that they must take in order to ensure proper installation. For example, if you must install one program before installing another, include this information.
- _Upgrade__:_ What steps does a user take if they are upgrading to a later version of software rather than performing a fresh installation?

- It is very important for the technical writer to perform these installations on their own so they can write accurate instructions.

### Release notes

- **Release notes** accompany a product when there is a new release or new version of the product.
- Release notes are version dependent and change with each iteration of the software, whereas typical user documentation is _not_ version dependent, meaning it can be used across many iterations of the product.
- Release notes also contain information about bugs or workarounds.
- Release notes are typically written in ASCII format in the shape of a _readme_ so that it is readable on any operating system. Make sure that your readmes are clearly written, as short as possible, and formatted in a way that allows for quick reading.
- Some examples of information found within a release note: new features, new documentation, bugs that were fixed, bugs that you know exist, but have not been fixed, tech-support information, and a list of which files and directories will change after this version is installed.

### Troubleshooting Documents

- Troubleshooting documentation contains descriptions of problems that the user might encounter, along with information about how to solve those problems.
- Figuring these problems out is typically a tough task for a technical writer, however, familiarity with the product, user testing, surveys, and feedback from trainers are good methods for discovering11 these issues.
- Another way of gathering this information is by asking developers to extract the error messages from the software so that you can see what errors they have encountered and expect to occur.

### Developer and API documentation

- Often times, technical writers don&#39;t get to write documentation for users like themselves. Instead, they are writing for much more experienced technical users who simply need reference material or API documentation to help them do their jobs.
- It is important to write solid and accurate information that is reviewed by someone who understands it. (This is why learning code is important)
- Until you become knowledgeable about the product and your audience, ask for help. It can feel annoying to continue pestering developers for resources, however, explain that you&#39;re working to learn the subject matter and that their support will help you reach your goal quicker.
- An **application programming interface** or API is a set of rules and specifications that software programs follow to communicate with each other.
- APIs are important for customers who want to use your organizations code to integrate your product into one of their existing applications.
- An API document must provide all the information necessary to enable another application to integrate to your product and perform all important tasks associated with the API.
- The API document should list all functions and their meanings
- A good way of tackling API documentation is by talking to the developers to figure out all the ways they believe their code should be used with regard to integration.
- Take samples of API documentation you find online, meet with developers to discuss which parts work best and figure out what you want to adopt for your document.

### Internal documents

- **Internal documents** are documents that are used within the organization and are not meant for customer consumption.
- Typically found within more established companies, these documents set standards for company functions.
- A lot of times, internal specifications are scattered throughout the minds of different developers, random PowerPoints, and other documents. It can be useful to standardize these documents within your own workplace so that they are more accessible and easier for others to use.
- **Requirement documents** explain what a product needs to be. A marketing requirement document describes what the product must include to meet customer needs, while a product requirement document defines the product and the features it must have.
- _The Moscow method_ determines priority and highlights what the products require. The four categories include must, should, could, won&#39;t. Moscow is an acronym of these words.
- **Specification Documents** define what a product or application does.
- **Design documents** describe how the software works and the architecture underlying that software. There are high-level and low level design documents.
- High-level design documents or **HLDD** are more of an abstract view of the system with less specific details.
- Low level design documents or **LLDD** include specific details and enough information for developers to do implementation from.
