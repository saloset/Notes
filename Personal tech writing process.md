## ST Technical Writing Process

This is a quick reference guide that outlines my basic technical writing process. This is a basic process that I have developed and tweaked over the years of being a student. The document contains some key questions, notes, and reminders, but is not very polished beyond that. Again, its just a reference guide!

---
#### 1. Plan
- Ask myself - How many documents do I need? What formats? What are their key characteristics? What production and style requirements do I need to be mindful of?
- Think about the process and how much time I&#39;ll need to complete each step? Consider how to fit this in with the final deadline.
- Who am I writing for? What is their experience level?
- Who will be my contact as an SME? Review?
- What do I know and what will I need to learn?
---
#### 2. Structure

- Planning structure beforehand so that I have a roadmap to go off of. It may change as the project evolves but planning the structure ahead of time allows for efficiency and organization.
- Figure out key info from SME
---
#### 3. Write

- Writing is only 10-30% of the process when planned out properly.
- Write following basic principles (simple, concise, 5Ws, active voice).
- Engage the SME to understand technical material and keep them in the loop to ensure the doc is going well.
- Format for rough draft at the end of this step
---
#### 4. Review

- Submit document for review by SME
- Testing a procedure/instruction to make sure the steps make sense.
- Peer review by a colleague
- Editing and re-proofing using an editing checklist and review log
---
### 5. Publish
- woo!
