# Notes section of my GitHub account
* The following files are various notes I have either written in the past, or are currently working on. Each file should be its own focused standalone set of notes. While each file may be broken down into many subsections of various topics, these topics shoul all be related to one another.
* If a file appears incomplete, I am probably still working on it! I add to these notes day by day.
* **These notes are strictly written for my own personal reference!** While I welcome anyone to use whatever they'd like for their own learning, they are written and formatted in the style that I take notes in.
* I also encourage any potential recruiter or hiring team to go through whatever they'd like to get a better picture of what, when, and how I work on learning new processes. Feel free to reach out with any questions!
